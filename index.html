    style= "font-size:200%;">  Life changing events police have profound are outrages. The recent deaths of George Floyd and more spurred widespread protest 
    against police brutality and raical injustice. Sadly, the trend of fatal police shootings in the United States seems to only be increasing, with a total 995 
    civilians having been shot,117 of whom were Black, as of December 2021. In 2020, there were 1,021 fatal police shootings, and in 2019 there were  999 fatal shootings.
    Law enforcement agencies across the country are failing to provide us with even basic information about the lives they take.
