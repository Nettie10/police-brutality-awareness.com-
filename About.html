    style= "font-size: 150%;"> Police brutality is the use of unnecessary force by police when dealing with civilians.Police brutality has historically 
    been perpetrated against individuals in lower socioeconomic levels and the social marginalized, commencing with worker strikes in the late 1800s and early 1900s. 
    Police brutality was permitted against citizens who challenged big industries. Police brutality was used to oppress labor strikes.Police would brutalize working-class 
    people and arrest them without cause. Police brutality was also a common occurrence during the civil rights era when activists would be sprayed down with water 
    hoses and attacked by police dogs. It has become a common topic of discussion and controversy  in recent years due to a surge of racially driven incidents, protests,
    and demonstrations. From the study of police brutality its historical and present-day context leting you understand the social issue starting with a simple question 
    — what is police brutality? Why its so important to know what your rights are?

    style= "font-size: 150%;">  The crime rate has increased. People often talk about bad apples, bad apples come from rotten trees and the rotten trees are law enforcement agencies imbued 
    with structural racism. According to article "How can we enhance police accountability in the United States?" Derek Chauvin the cop who killed George Floyd have been involved in at least 18
    police misconduct cases. He have been involved in police shootings, and cases of police brutality. Its a pattern and yet nothing happenes no action have been taking. Cops are usally dismissed, 
    typically the Fraternal Order of Police has helped them resign quietly instead of being fired. Which gives bad officers the ability to work for another department.
    And when it do happen they are rarely known outside the department until long after the incident and the conduct decision.

    <h3 class="center">Avoid issue</h3>
<p class="center"
    style= "font-size: 150%;"> Individuals who are confronted by law enforcement may wish to be particularly careful, especially if they are a person in a group that 
    has been historically marginalized. He or she may keep his or her hands on the wheel during a traffic stop and be polite. He or she may avoid sudden movements that 
    may be perceived as threatening to a law enforcement officer, especially at night during a traffic stop. They may comply with requests without giving up their rights. 
    They may also choose to listen to police instructions to prevent becoming a victim of police brutality.
